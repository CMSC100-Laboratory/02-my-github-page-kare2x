## How to Create Github Page
1. Accept the assignment we created specifically for you. After accepting it, you&#39;ll notice that a repository named 02-my-github-page-carlodb is automatically created. The repository name is structured with 02-my-github-page as the standard name for this activity, which cannot be changed, followed by carlodb, which is your GitHub username.
2. Clone the remote repository to your local machine. This will allow you to add customizable HTML static pages with CSS. When cloning the repository, be sure to follow the proper structure to avoid issues with pushing changes later in the lesson. Additionally, you need to configure Git in your local repository by setting your username and email. This configuration helps track who pushes changes to the remote Git repository.
3. Change the visibility of your Git repository to public, then configure GitHub Pages through the settings by selecting which part of the branch you will use to host your static website.
